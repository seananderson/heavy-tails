% version = 1.02 of citesupernumber.sty 1998 May 3
% origin 1989 January 20
% originally named citsupernumber.tex, but citesupernumber.sty works
%
% call in LaTeX2e:
% \usepackage{citesupernumber}
%
% This file makes citations be superscripted.  They come out as numbers.
% For example, by putting the following code in your LaTeX file,
%
%     text text text\cite{Darwin1859,Clark2001} text ...
%     \input citesupernumber
%     moretext moretext moretext\cite{Darwin1859,Clark2001} moretext ...
%
% you will get:
% 
%     text text text[1,2] text ...
%
%                              1,2
%     moretext moretext moretext   moretext ...

% NOTE:  By making this a package, the above switch does not work!!
% But then, would one really want to switch like that?

%
% This code was originally made by 
% Michael DeCorte // (315)265-2439 // P.O. Box 652, Potsdam, NY 13676
% Internet: mrd@sun.soe.clarkson.edu  // Bitnet:   mrd@clutx.bitnet        
% 
% It was modified by Tom Schneider toms@ncifcrf.gov

% DeCorte's original code was:
% \def\@cite#1#2{$^{#1\if@tempswa , #2\fi}$}
% I have added the \scriptsize so that the numbers are appropriately smaller
% and the mbox to make scriptsize work under the mathmode that is
% used to make the superscripting.
%

\makeatletter
\def\@cite#1#2{$^{\mbox{\scriptsize #1\if@tempswa , #2\fi}}$}
\makeatother

% ---------------------------------------------------
% If the following line:
% \def\cite#1{$^{#1}$}
% is also used, the output would be:
%                               Darwin1859,Clark2001
%     moretext moretext moretext                    moretext ...
%
% ---------------------------------------------------
% The next improvement of this would be to make it more like a
% switch, so one would say \citesupernumber or \citesuperkey
% or \citebracket or \citeparenthesis to get different forms.
% Better yet would be \citationform{place}{kind}{edge}
% where
%       place is 'inline' or 'superscript'
%       kind is 'citationkey' or 'number'
%       edge is 'bracket' or 'parenthesis' or 'none'
% Do you know how to make this happen?
% 
% While we are into wishing, it would be useful for some journals
% to have the following citation forms built, not from the key,
% but from the year and author list:
% One author:   (Smith, 1982)
% Two authors:  (Smith and Jones 1892)
% More than two authors:  (Smith {\em et al}, 1982)
% with ';' as separators between the citations.
